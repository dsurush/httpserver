<p align="center">"Hello"

    Hello, it's me
    I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
    To go over everything
    They say that time's supposed to heal ya
    But I ain't done much healing
    Hello, can you hear me?
    I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
    When we were younger and free
    I've forgotten how it felt
    Before the world fell at our feet

    There's such a difference between us
    And a million miles

    Hello from the other side
    I must have called a thousand times
    To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
    But when I call you never seem to be home
    Hello from the outside
    At least I can say that I've tried
    To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
    But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart
    Anymore

    Hello, how are you?
    It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
    I hope that you're well
    Did you ever make it out of that town
    Where nothing ever happened?

    It's no secret that the both of us
    Are running out of time

    So hello from the other side (other side)
    I must have called a thousand times (thousand times)
    To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
    But when I call you never seem to be home
    Hello from the outside (outside)
    At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
    To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
    But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart
    Anymore

    (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
    Anymore
    (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
    Anymore
    (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
    Anymore
    (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
    Anymore

    Hello from the other side (other side)

    Hello from the outside (outside)
